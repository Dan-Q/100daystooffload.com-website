<p><code>#100DaysToOffload</code> is a simple concept that <a href="https://kevq.uk">Kev Quirk</a> thought of one day. The rationale behind the whole thing is to challenge people to publish 100 posts on their <b>personal blog</b> in a year. That's approximately 1 post every 3.5 days.</p>

<p>The point of <code>#100DaysToOffload</code> is to be a relaxing and cathartic experience. Not a worrisome affair where you’re thinking of things to write all the time.</p>

<p>Posts don’t need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written. If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if there’s no real point to the post, so what? What’s important is that you’re writing about the things you want to write about.</p>

<p>Your posts could be how-to guids, or links to another post you have found interesting. They could include your own thoughts about that post, or a response to it. It could be a simple update about what you have done that day. Tell us about your dog, your cat, your fish tank, or whatever hobbies you have. Someone will find it interesting.</p>

<h4>Just. Write.</h4>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>I don’t like to term ‘rules’ so let’s go with ‘guidelines’ instead. As I don’t think this whole thing shouldn’t be too rigid. Here’s the guidelines as I see them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This needs to be done on a personal blog, not a corporate blog. If you don’t have a personal blog, you can sign up for a free one at <a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a>.</li>
  <li>There is no specific start or end date. Your 100 posts can start or end whenever you want them to.</li>
  <li>Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year. You don't need to publish a post every 3 days - if you want a week off, that's fine. If it comes to the end of the year and you have only published 60 posts, that's also fine. <b>Just. Write</b>.</li>
  <li>There are no limits to what you can post about – write about whatever interests you.</li>
  <li>There are no limits to how short or long a post needs to be.</li>
  <li>Search engine optimisation, what’s that? Forget about all that jargon. <b>Just. Write</b>.</li>
  <li>Once you have published an article, don’t forget to post a link on your social media with the hashtag <code>#100DaysToOffload</code>.</li>
	<li>If you're writing on Write.as, be sure to include <code>#100DaysToOffload</code> in your post. Their system support hashtags, so it will allow others to find your posts.</li>
  <li>Get your friends involved!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>Here’s how I will be working my way through <code>#100DaysToOffload</code> on my personal site:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I’ll try to publish 100 posts within a year.</li>
	<li>Every post in the series will end with a link to this site. Something like “I’m publishing this as part of 100 Days To Offload. You can join in yourself by visiting https://100daystooffload.com.</li>
	<li>Once I’ve published a post on my personal site, I will share a link to my post on my social media channels with the hashtag <code>#100DaysToOffload</code>.</li>
